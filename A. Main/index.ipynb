    "## 1.0 Business Understanding\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2021, the United States real estate industry boasted a staggering valuation of USD 3.69 trillion. Forecasts projected a promising future, with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 5.2% anticipated between 2022 and 2030. This projected growth, coupled with the rising population rates in the US, presents an immensely lucrative opportunity for real estate investors to capitalize on substantial profits. However, success in this realm hinges upon the prudent management of risk and making astute investment choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the experts at [People's Capital Group](https://www.peoplescapitalgroup.com/average-roi-real-estate/), residential properties exhibit an average annual return of 10.6%, while commercial properties yield an average return of 9.5%. These figures illustrate the potential for lucrative returns in the real estate market, further emphasizing the importance of making well-informed investment decisions and adopting effective risk management strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholder for this project is a real estate investment firm aiming to construct residential homes in the United States' most lucrative locations, ensuring a high return on their investment. To achieve this goal, the project focuses on conducting a time series analysis utilizing a Zillow dataset that encompasses various locations across the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the project involves analyzing house sale prices spanning from 1996 to 2018. By leveraging this data, the aim is to identify the top five locations that offer the highest Return on Investment (ROI) potential. Additionally, considering the stakeholder's risk-averse nature, the project aims to recommend locations characterized by low price volatility. This quality will enable the model to provide reliable predictions, enhancing the stakeholder's ability to make informed investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project centers on utilizing time series analysis techniques and the Zillow dataset to pinpoint the top five locations in the US that not only offer a high ROI but also exhibit low price volatility, aligning with the risk preferences of the real estate investment firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Metric of Success\n",
    "\n",
    "For our time series analysis, we have selected the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as the metric of success to assess the viability of the model. MAPE has been chosen due to its ability to provide weighted error values, where errors are divided by the true values. This characteristic is particularly advantageous in handling outliers effectively. In contrast, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) solely considers the difference between the real and predicted values, which can be misleading if outliers exist in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing MAPE, we aim to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance that accounts for both the magnitude of errors and the relative proportion they represent. This metric offers a more robust assessment and ensures that outliers do not unduly influence the perception of the model's effectiveness in generating accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, MAPE has been chosen as the preferred metric to gauge the model's performance in our time series analysis. It provides a reliable indication of the model's ability to forecast accurately, considering the potential presence of outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Project Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The central objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive time series analysis to forecast and identify the top five locations for investment based on Return on Investment (ROI). By leveraging historical data and employing predictive modeling techniques, the project aims to determine the most promising locations that offer the highest potential returns for real estate investors. Through this analysis, the project seeks to provide actionable insights and recommendations that will assist the stakeholders in making informed investment decisions in pursuit of optimal ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Problem Questions\n",
    "1. What are the five best locations to invest in around the US?\n",
    "2. What makes these locations so lucrative?\n",
    "3. Does urbanization affect the prices of houses?\n",
    "4. Where are the locations of the houses with the highest price volatility?\n",
    "5. Can future median house prices be effectively predicted?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Project Objectives\n",
    "1. Provide effective real estate investment recommendations to the stakeholder.\n",
    "2. Increase the real estate investor’s customer base.\n",

    "### 3.3 Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the development of a robust and accurate model, several data cleaning techniques will be applied to the dataset. The following techniques will be employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Completeness`: This technique involves addressing missing values within the dataset. Steps will be taken to identify and handle missing data appropriately, either through imputation or removal, to ensure that the dataset is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Consistency`: The consistency of the data will be examined to identify any discrepancies or irregularities. Inconsistencies in variables, such as conflicting formats or conflicting information within the dataset, will be addressed and resolved to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Validity`: Validity refers to the accuracy and relevance of the data. Data validation techniques will be applied to verify that the values within each variable align with expected ranges or predefined criteria. Any invalid or erroneous data points will be rectified or removed from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Collinearity`: Collinearity examines the presence of highly correlated variables. Multicollinearity can affect the model's stability and interpretability. Techniques such as correlation analysis will be utilized to identify highly correlated variables. If necessary, appropriate measures, such as feature selection or dimensionality reduction, will be implemented to address collinearity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Outlier removal`: Outliers, which are extreme or unusual data points, can adversely impact the model's performance. Robust statistical techniques will be employed to detect and handle outliers effectively. Outliers may be removed or transformed to minimize their influence on the analysis and modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these data cleaning techniques, the dataset will be refined and prepared, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the data before proceeding with the subsequent stages of analysis and modeling."

    "To accurately represent the locations, the Zipcode column will be converted from the integer data type to the string data type. Since zip codes are categorical identifiers that correspond to specific geographical areas, it is more appropriate to treat them as categorical variables rather than numerical ones. By converting the Zipcode column to string type, it ensures that the analysis and modeling processes treat it as a categorical feature, enabling meaningful interpretations and appropriate handling during data manipulation and modeling steps."

It has been observed that some zip codes contain four digits, suggesting a missing zero at the beginning. Therefore, the column will be modified to include a leading zero for zip codes with four digits, aligning them with the standard format of five-digit zip codes. This restructuring will ensure uniformity in the zip code representation, enabling accurate analysis and modeling based on this variable."

    "\n",
    "To facilitate time series analysis, the dataframe will be transformed from a wide view to a long view format. This transformation involves restructuring the dataframe to have a single column for the Date and another column for the corresponding values. The Date column will be set as the index to establish the temporal order of the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "By converting the dataframe to a long view format and indexing it by the Date, the data will be organized in a sequential manner, enabling the application of time series analysis techniques such as trend analysis, seasonality detection, and forecasting. This transformation allows for a more comprehensive exploration of the temporal patterns and trends within the dataset, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of the subsequent time series modeling and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the availability of different perspectives for exploratory data analysis (EDA), a copy of the dataset will be made. The original dataset will be preserved in its wide view format to facilitate EDA from that perspective. Meanwhile, the copy of the dataset will be transformed into a long view format, creating a new dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having both the long and wide view datasets, the EDA process will benefit from diverse analytical approaches. The wide view format of the original dataset allows for a comprehensive examination of the data across various columns, providing insights into the overall distribution and patterns. On the other hand, the long view format of the copied dataset enables a focused analysis on the temporal dimension, utilizing time series techniques to explore trends, seasonality, and relationships over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having these two versions of the dataset, each with its own viewpoint, ensures a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the data during the EDA phase. This approach enhances the insights derived from the analysis and provides a holistic understanding of the dataset from both wide and long view perspectives."
