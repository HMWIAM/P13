    "## 1.0 Business Understanding\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2021, the United States real estate industry boasted a staggering valuation of USD 3.69 trillion. Forecasts projected a promising future, with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 5.2% anticipated between 2022 and 2030. This projected growth, coupled with the rising population rates in the US, presents an immensely lucrative opportunity for real estate investors to capitalize on substantial profits. However, success in this realm hinges upon the prudent management of risk and making astute investment choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the experts at [People's Capital Group](https://www.peoplescapitalgroup.com/average-roi-real-estate/), residential properties exhibit an average annual return of 10.6%, while commercial properties yield an average return of 9.5%. These figures illustrate the potential for lucrative returns in the real estate market, further emphasizing the importance of making well-informed investment decisions and adopting effective risk management strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholder for this project is a real estate investment firm aiming to construct residential homes in the United States' most lucrative locations, ensuring a high return on their investment. To achieve this goal, the project focuses on conducting a time series analysis utilizing a Zillow dataset that encompasses various locations across the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the project involves analyzing house sale prices spanning from 1996 to 2018. By leveraging this data, the aim is to identify the top five locations that offer the highest Return on Investment (ROI) potential. Additionally, considering the stakeholder's risk-averse nature, the project aims to recommend locations characterized by low price volatility. This quality will enable the model to provide reliable predictions, enhancing the stakeholder's ability to make informed investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project centers on utilizing time series analysis techniques and the Zillow dataset to pinpoint the top ten locations in the US that not only offer a high ROI but also exhibit low price volatility, aligning with the risk preferences of the real estate investment firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Metric of Success\n",
    "\n",
    "For our time series analysis, we have selected the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as the metric of success to assess the viability of the model. MAPE has been chosen due to its ability to provide weighted error values, where errors are divided by the true values. This characteristic is particularly advantageous in handling outliers effectively. In contrast, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) solely considers the difference between the real and predicted values, which can be misleading if outliers exist in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing MAPE, we aim to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance that accounts for both the magnitude of errors and the relative proportion they represent. This metric offers a more robust assessment and ensures that outliers do not unduly influence the perception of the model's effectiveness in generating accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, MAPE has been chosen as the preferred metric to gauge the model's performance in our time series analysis. It provides a reliable indication of the model's ability to forecast accurately, considering the potential presence of outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Project Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The central objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive time series analysis to forecast and identify the top ten locations for investment based on Return on Investment (ROI). By leveraging historical data and employing predictive modeling techniques, the project aims to determine the most promising locations that offer the highest potential returns for real estate investors. Through this analysis, the project seeks to provide actionable insights and recommendations that will assist the stakeholders in making informed investment decisions in pursuit of optimal ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Problem Questions\n",
    "1. What are the five best locations to invest in around the US?\n",
    "2. What makes these locations so lucrative?\n",
    "3. Does urbanization affect the prices of houses?\n",
    "4. Where are the locations of the houses with the highest price volatility?\n",
    "5. Can future median house prices be effectively predicted?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Project Objectives\n",
    "1. Provide effective real estate investment recommendations to the stakeholder.\n",
    "2. Increase the real estate investor’s customer base.\n",

    "The dataset utilized in this project consists of historical median house prices sampled from various states in the United States. The data spans a period of 22 years, specifically from April 1996 to April 2018. The information was obtained from the official website of Zillow, a prominent real estate and rental marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comprises a total of 14,723 rows and 272 columns. Among these columns, four are categorical variables, while the remaining columns are numerical in nature.\n",

    "Here is a brief overview of the column names and their descriptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `RegionID`: A unique identifier assigned to each region.\n",
    "* `RegionName`: The names of the regions, typically representing zip codes.\n",
    "* `City`: The corresponding city names associated with the regions.\n",
    "* `State`: The names of the states to which the regions belong.\n",
    "* `Metro`: The names of the metropolitan areas to which the regions are affiliated.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the development of a robust and accurate model, several data cleaning techniques will be applied to the dataset. The following techniques will be employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Completeness`: This technique involves addressing missing values within the dataset. Steps will be taken to identify and handle missing data appropriately, either through imputation or removal, to ensure that the dataset is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Consistency`: The consistency of the data will be examined to identify any discrepancies or irregularities. Inconsistencies in variables, such as conflicting formats or conflicting information within the dataset, will be addressed and resolved to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Validity`: Validity refers to the accuracy and relevance of the data. Data validation techniques will be applied to verify that the values within each variable align with expected ranges or predefined criteria. Any invalid or erroneous data points will be rectified or removed from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Collinearity`: Collinearity examines the presence of highly correlated variables. Multicollinearity can affect the model's stability and interpretability. Techniques such as correlation analysis will be utilized to identify highly correlated variables. If necessary, appropriate measures, such as feature selection or dimensionality reduction, will be implemented to address collinearity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Outlier removal`: Outliers, which are extreme or unusual data points, can adversely impact the model's performance. Robust statistical techniques will be employed to detect and handle outliers effectively. Outliers may be removed or transformed to minimize their influence on the analysis and modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these data cleaning techniques, the dataset will be refined and prepared, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the data before proceeding with the subsequent stages of analysis and modeling."
