Time series - Zillow

1.0 Business Understanding

1.1 Introduction

We introduced the real estate industry in the USA, its valuation etc
We then proceeded to tell about the ROI of residential and commercial returns.
We showed why its important in making investments decisions.

1.2 Problem statement

We can up with the problem statement where a stakeholder aims to
construct residential homes in the USA.
To achieve this we were tasked to use time series analysis using zillow
dataset to find the top 10 locations where they can have the highest 
ROI and have the lowest price volatility.

"The stakeholder for this project is a real estate investment firm aiming
to construct residential homes in the United States' most lucrative locations,
ensuring a high return on their investment. To achieve this goal, the project 
focuses on conducting a time series analysis utilizing a Zillow dataset that 
encompasses various locations across the country.

Specifically, the project involves analyzing house sale prices spanning 
from 1996 to 2018. By leveraging this data, the aim is to identify the top 
five locations that offer the highest Return on Investment (ROI) potential. 
Additionally, considering the stakeholder's risk-averse nature, the project 
aims to recommend locations characterized by low price volatility.
This quality will enable the model to provide reliable predictions, 
enhancing the stakeholder's ability to make informed investment decisions.

Overall, the project centers on utilizing time series analysis techniques and
the Zillow dataset to pinpoint the top ten locations in the US that not only
offer a high ROI but also exhibit low price volatility, aligning with the 
risk preferences of the real estate investment firm."

1.3 Metrics of Success

We will use MAPE(Mean Absolute Percentage Error) here.
MAPE is choesen due to its ability to provide weighted error values
It is good at handling outliers
By utilizing MAPE, we aim to obtain a comprehensive evaluation
of the model's performance that accounts for both the magnitude
of errors and the relative proportion they represent. 
This metric offers a more robust assessment and ensures that 
outliers do not unduly influence the perception of the model's 
effectiveness in generating accurate predictions.

Alternative
Use RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) instead

1.5 Problem Questions?

1. What are the 10 best locations to invest/construct in the USA?
(We use the zipcode as the location point)

2. What makes these locations valuable?
(Is it the city, metro, the state, the county, ROI, value of properties)

3. What affect does urbanization have on value of houses
()
4. The locations with the highest/lowest volatility?
(this is to ensure that the value of property remain stable)
(Use Zipcode and the duration of time passed)

5. Can we predict the value of property?
(The point of this project)

1.6 Objectives?

1. Provide effective real estate investment
recommendations to the stakeholder.
(Through predicting what the value of property may be)

2. Increase the real estate investorâ€™s customer base.
(Through constructing in areas with stable and growing value
we will attract survey investors/ home buyers who treat there homes 
as assets.)

2.0 Data Understanding
We explore the various columns

The dataset utilized in this project consists of 
historical median house prices sampled from various states in 
the United States. The data spans a period of 22 years, 
specifically from April 1996 to April 2018. The information was 
obtained from the official website of Zillow, a prominent real estate 
and rental marketplace.

The dataset comprises a total of 14,723 rows and 272 columns. 
Among these columns, four are categorical variables, while the 
remaining columns are numerical in nature.

Here is a brief overview of the column names and their descriptions:

* `RegionID`: A unique identifier assigned to each region.
* `RegionName`: The names of the regions, typically representing zip codes.
* `City`: The corresponding city names associated with the regions.
* `State`: The names of the states to which the regions belong.
* `Metro`: The names of the metropolitan areas to which the regions are affiliated.
* `County Name`: The names of the counties where the regions are located.
* `Size Rank`: The ranking of zip codes based on their level of urbanization.
* `Date Columns (265 Columns)`: These columns represent median house prices recorded across different years.

By utilizing this dataset, the project aims to extract insights and patterns from the historical median house prices in order to predict the top investment locations with the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

3.0 Data Preparation
Imported the libraries
Loaded the data

3.3 Data cleaning

1. Completeness: 
Check for missing datasets
Display the missing data
Metro had 1043, filled with 'missing' as can be an important indicator.
Date had 1039, interpolated them

2. Consistency:
Check for duplicates:
There were no duplicates

3. Validity:
Make sure that columns is accurate and appropriate 
Changed 'RegionName' to 'Zipcode'

4. Uniformity:
Make sure that the datatype are appropriate for the analysis
Converted Zipcode(integer) to a string that is categorical
Zipcode is attached to a physical location. 
This means that, it should be treated as a location(categorical)
Also made them all have 5 digits.

Alternative, treat it as a numerical?

Multicollinearity?
Outliers?

4.0 Data Preprocessing

1. Added the columns ROI and CV
2. Reshaped the dataset and using the melt data function
3. Made a new column(Date) using the melt dataset and made it the index
4. Renamed value column from melted dateset to median house 
price for easier understanding.


5.0 Exploratory Data Analysis

As per our objectives, we will use EDA to determine:

1. The top 10 zipcodes/locations with the highest ROI: 
We will analyze the ROI values for different zipcodes/locations and
identify the top 10 areas with the highest returns on investment.

2. The zipcodes/locations with high price volatility: 
We will examine the price volatility of properties in different
zipcodes/locations to identify areas with high fluctuations in 
property prices. This information will help us find locations with stable 
property values.

3. The cities/states with the highest valued property: 
We will explore the dataset to determine which cities or states 
have the highest property values. This analysis will provide insights
into areas where property prices are generally high.

4. Whether urbanization affects property values:
We will investigate the relationship between urbanization 
and property values. By analyzing relevant variables such as 
population density, city size, or proximity to urban centers,
we can determine whether urbanization has an impact on property values.

5. The trend of property prices over the years:
We will analyze the historical trend of property prices over time. 
This analysis will help us identify any patterns, trends, or fluctuations 
in property prices that may be useful for predicting future values.
